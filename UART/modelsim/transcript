#     The vsim tool provides HDL simulation based on the compiled and optimized
#     design and it provides various post-simulation analysis capabilities. In
#     simulation mode it expects to be provided with the optimization output for
#     the root of the design, or it will automatically produce such an
#     optimization from the root of the design.
